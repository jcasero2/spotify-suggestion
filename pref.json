Nah, you ain't sayin' nothin' Add a couple bitches, what's the problem? Now they make a sum Walk Man doin' laps, it got us on the run Bitch, you knowin' that we on the roll and that the tape is done, ah I'm whippin' somethin' foreign with expired tags Signin' on the dotted line, whatever's gonna get the bag The little man, short-sighted, my decisions bad Just 'cause I'm the funny guy does not mean that I'm callin' back So quick, bitch, we workin' both ends We put shit in motion, we just dipped our toes in, like woah"
