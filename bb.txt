I don't want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some more
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I-I-I don't want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some more
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I fuck her long, ain't no Minute Maid
My diamonds lemonade
Flexing hard, call me Popeye
Wallet filled with spinach ay
Cut you off on the interstate
I'm first to finish, ay
I'm a young rich nigga
Bitch it's always been that way
To the grave, might just be tomorrow
Might just be today
So i always live it up, we poppin' bottles, poppin' Ks
Gucci shades from my boujee bitch, ain't even had to pay
Had to put on for the team
And had to put on for the bay
I'm so fly when I rock robins wings
I can't stay in one place
Russian cremes in my rocket ship
We go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it
I can't catch a case
Blast off, blast off
See the stars up in wraith
You can't get into the crib
Because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section
I'm gon' put you in your place
If the club goin' up
You bet I'm sliding like a chase
And i think I fell in love
She shook that ass up in my face
I don't want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some more
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I-I-I don't want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some more
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I-I-I-I don't want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some more
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I-I-I don't want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some more
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed
