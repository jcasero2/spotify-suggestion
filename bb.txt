Uh, yeah, ayy
Now hold up, bro, what the fuck you say? Nah, you ain't sayin' nothin'
Add a couple bitches, what's the problem? Now they make a sum
"Walk Man" doin' laps, it got us on the run
Bitch, you knowin' that we on the roll and that the tape is done, ah
I'm whippin' somethin' foreign with expired tags
Signin' on the dotted line, whatever's gonna get the bag
The little man, short-sighted, my decisions bad
Just 'cause I'm the funny guy does not mean that I'm callin' back
So quick, bitch, we workin' both ends
We put shit in motion, we just dipped our toes in, like woah
Man, I tell that broke bitch
If you wanna get in tune, better change your whole pitch, like yo
So quick, bitch, we workin' both ends
We put shit in motion, we just dipped our toes in, like woah (Yeah)
Man, tell that broke bitch
Oh shit, it's us again, she can't fuck with me, so she just fuck my friends
I can't get pulled over on the road 'cause I got contraband
My whip be creepin' on the ten, I'm feelin' weird again
They say, "Cody, grow up," I say, "Bitch, I'm goin' Peter Pan"
Uh, bank account look like some Cheerios (Yum)
You can't see us 'cause we flyin' low
Ain't nothin' 'bout it predisposed
But the shit we make got legs and take off like a runny nose
So quick, bitch, we workin' both ends
We put shit in motion, we just dipped our toes in, like woah
Man, I tell that broke bitch
If you wanna get in tune, better change your whole pitch, like yo
So quick, bitch, we workin' both ends
We put shit in motion, we just dipped our toes in, like woah (Yeah)
Man, tell that broke bitch
We movin' fast, y'all don't even know my race
And we know you're micro soft, boy, we call you Billy Gates
I'm gainin' weight, uh, we cookin' as of late
Got no taste for bein' broke so we ain't takin' any breaks
Man, you talkin' all cap, we just stick to low-key
Call me Thor 'cause she want my fuckin' hammer, Loki
And we baggin' up the green, I don't even smoke tree
I'm her mainline, baby, 'cause she tryna OD
So quick, bitch, we workin' both ends
We put shit in motion, we just dipped our toes in, like woah
Man, I tell that broke bitch
If you wanna get in tune, better change your whole pitch, like yo
So quick, bitch, we workin' both ends
We put shit in motion, we just dipped our toes in, like woah (Yeah)
Man, tell that broke bitch
If you wanna get in tune, better change your whole pitch
If you wanna get in tune, better change your whole pitch, like
Tell that broke bitch, tell that, tell that broke bitch
If you wanna get in tune, better change your whole pitch, like
Man, tell that broke bitch
